# Past Days
Being working on project I get from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGU5kIG7b2I. Planning on using his code as a base.
Reading from Deep Learning Book and understand all what he already did and improve on it.

# 3rd April
Create git repo and pushed.

In trying to understanding the architecture of the LSTM network (Book: Deep Learning, page 413) I am struggling to fully
understanding the meaning of the i and j indexing in the provided equations (10.33, 10.34, 10.35, 10.36, 10.37).

alfu: i just went through the equations you mentioned in the DL book (https://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html) and didnt
see any variable Ã¬`and `j` in those equations. what i see are superscripts ranging from 1 to some number `tau` (the t-ish symbol). I should admit that this
book is not the easiest book out there to learn deep learning. Giving that you had no machine/deep learning lectures, you should first
spend a lot of time reading Part 1 of the book. Otherwise it will be very confusing for you

i index seems to define the layer in the network..

Screenshots of the book (Deep Learning - Goodfellow, I) page is provided in the repo dir /screenshots.
